Author: Nov05  
Date: May 16, 2021  

The proposal contains the following parts:
1. The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
2. A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
3. The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
4. A solution statement — the solution proposed for the problem given;
5. A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
6. A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
7. An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.

## Project's Domain Background

In this project, we will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We will use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we will employ a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and develop a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that we will use is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
