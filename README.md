# udacity-mle-sagemaker-capstone
Created on 2021-05-15 for Udacity Nano degree "Machine Learning Engineer"

## Project Overview

### Build Your Machine Learning Project

In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the program to build a machine learning engineer project of your choosing. Your project deliverables are:

1. A Github repository of your work.
2. A blog post written for a technical audience, or a deployed web application powered by data.

In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice.

1. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions.
2. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.
3. You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way.
4. Afterwards, you will collect results about your findings, visualize significant quantities, validate/justify your results, and make any concluding remarks about whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
5. Finally, you will construct a blog post to document all of the steps from start to finish of your project, or deploy your results into a web application.

### Setting Yourself Apart

An important part of landing a job or advancing your career as a machine learning engineer is setting yourself apart through impressive projects. By now, you've completed several guided projects, and now's your chance to show off your skills and creativity. You'll receive a review and feedback from a Udacity mentor, and they will focus on how your project demonstrates your skills.

This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

1. How to research and investigate a real-world problem of interest.
2. How to accurately apply specific data science algorithms and techniques.
3. How to properly analyze and visualize your data and results for validity.
4. How to document and write a report of your work.

### Udacity + Arvato Financial Solutions: Identify Customers from a Mailout Campaign

This competition is connected to one of Udacity's capstone project options for the Data Science Nanodegree program, in connection with Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary.

In the project, a mail-order sales company in Germany is interested in identifying segments of the general population to target with their marketing in order to grow. Demographics information has been provided for both the general population at large as well as for prior customers of the mail-order company in order to build a model of the customer base of the company. The target dataset contains demographics information for targets of a mailout marketing campaign. The objective is to identify which individuals are most likely to respond to the campaign and become customers of the mail-order company.

As part of the project, half of the mailout data has been provided with included response column. For the competition, the remaining half of the mailout data has had its response column withheld; the competition will be scored based on the predictions on that half of the data.
